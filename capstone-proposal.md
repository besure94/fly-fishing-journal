# Capstone Project Proposal

#### By Brian Scherner

### Name of Project: Fly Fishing Journal

### Project's Purpose or Goal:

The goal of this project is to allow a user to log their past fly fishing trips, and log their planned future trips as well.
This is intended for my father, as he is an avid fly fisherman.

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* A web app with full CRUD functionality. A user should be able to create past/future trips, view their details, edit them, and delete them.

* CSS styling

* Different locations inside the app: one for logging past trips, and one for future trips

* The application should be connected to a database to save all of the information for each trip.

* The user should be able to log in and out of the application.

* Each past trip logged in the app should include the following info:

	· Fishing Destination: Domestic or International?

	· Freshwater or Saltwater?

	· River or Lake (Example: Stillwater)?

	· Fish Species: trout, salmon, steelhead, bass, panfish, northern pike, carp/saltwater bonefish, tarpon, permit, etc.

	· Fishing Location: Country, State, County

	· Fishing Access: by vehicle type, boat, plane, hiking

	· Fishing Method: Wading, drift boat, raft, inflatable kickboat w/fins

	· Fishing Regulations & Licenses

	· Private or Public water fees?

	· Time of Year

	· Time of Day

	· Travel Time to Destination

	· River flow levels in cfs or gauge height in feet

	· Fly Fishing Tackle Used (rod weight and length, reel size, fly line and leader type used)

	· Flies Used (by name, size, and color)

	· Fish Caught (species, quantity, size)

* Each future trip logged in the app should include the following info:

	· Domestic/International

  · Guided/Unguided

  · Freshwater/Saltwater Trip

  · Fish Species: trout, salmon, steelhead, bass, panfish, northern pike, carp/saltwater bonefish, tarpon, permit, etc.

  · Air Travel Costs

  · Passport/Visa

  · Fishing & Lodging Expenses

  · Deposit Payment Terms

  · Refund Cancellation Policies

  · Clothing Requirements

  · Climate Information

  · Fishing Tackle Requirements (rod, reel, line, leader)

  · Required Flies List

  · Baggage & Luggage Policies

  · Trip & Medical Evacuation Insurance

  · Fishing Licenses

  · Cellular & wifi communications and costs

  · Gratuity Guidelines

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React

* JavaScript

* JSX

* HTML

* CSS

* NPM

* Webpack

* Firebase

* Firestore

#### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

In order of importance:

1. Import this app to a mobile application. The docs on Ionic Framework make this sound like a fairly simple task.

2. Use weather API data to display the weather conditions for a past trip, and/or the forecast for an upcoming trip. When the user logs a past trip, they should be able to include the weather conditions from that trip. They should be able to do the same for a future trip, although this may not be possible if the trip is scheduled far in advance.

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

1. Will use Ionic Framework to port the app over to a mobile application.

2. Will use OpenWeatherMap API to display weather conditions for past and future trips.

#### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
