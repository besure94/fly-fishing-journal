# Fly Fishing Journal

#### An application that allows a user to log their past fly fishing trips, as well as their planned future trips. This will be my capstone project for Epicodus. This repository is subject to change upon approval by my instructor.

#### By Brian Scherner

## Description

The purpose of this application is to allow a user to keep a virtual journal of their past and future fly fishing trips. This is designed to be used by my father, who is an avid fly fisherman.
